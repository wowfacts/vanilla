## Gameplay

### General
 - Resurrecion Sickness does not effect players below level 10.

### Professions
#### Gathering
 - Gathering from a node can fail, resulting in the node needing to be clicked again.

#### Mining
 - Mining nodes found in the world required often multiple clicks to retrieve all the the resources from it.

## Classes
### General / Multi-class
 - At level 10 all classes earned a talent point, each level after this provided 1 additional talent point, resulting in 51 talents at level 60.
 - Spells had ranks and new ranks were not automatically trained but bought.
 - Higher rank spells cost more mana, so people would often use lower rank spells.
 - A lot of classes had 3 weapon slots, the third usually being for a ranged weapon.  (This often caused hunters to lose weapons to a warrior or a rogue, because they also wanted the additional stats the weapon provided).
 - All weapons had a different weapon skill which would need to be levelled up by using a weapon of that type.  Having low skill would result in a lot more misses than usual.

### Hunter

#### Weapons / Combat
 - Bows/Guns have a minimum range of around 8 yards, if a mob is closer than this you have to melee or kite.
 - Bows/Guns used ammunition which had to be bought at a vendor or crafted.
   * Ammunition came in various forms, higher level ammo did more damage than lower level, see: [Light Shot](http://www.wowhead.com/item=2516/light-shot).
   * There was also a special ammunition which did not run out of charges.

#### Pets
 - Pets had to be kept happy, if they became angry with you, you would lose them, and have to tame a new pet.
